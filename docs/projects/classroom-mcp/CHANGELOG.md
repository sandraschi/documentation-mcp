# Changelog

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- `student_update`, `class_update`, `course_update` — update-by-ID tools.
  Previously only create/upsert-by-natural-key existed, so fixing a typo in
  a student's name or a course's title meant delete-and-recreate, which
  lost every FK relationship (assignments, progress, modules) pointing at
  that row.
- Human Teachers in the Loop: `human_teacher_create/list/get/delete`,
  `referral_create/list/update_status` — the marketplace concept from
  learnbot-mcp's `docs/DISTANCE_LEARNING.md`, now implemented.
- `syllabus_generate`, `courseware_generate_ai` — AI-generated curriculum
  content per course, framework-aware (CEFR, HSK, DELF, DELE, Goethe, JLPT).
- `framework` field on students/classes.
- `assignment_create_with_lesson` — bridges to learnbot-mcp's
  `lesson_generate` via `LEARNBOT_URL` to back an assignment with real
  lesson content.

### Fixed
- `student_upsert` / `human_teacher_upsert` — blank email defaulted to
  `""`, which collides under the `email` column's `UNIQUE` constraint.
  Creating a second student/teacher with no email silently overwrote the
  first one's data instead of creating a new row. Now stores `NULL` for a
  blank email (SQLite treats `NULL` as always-distinct under `UNIQUE`,
  unlike `""`).
- `human_teacher_upsert`'s bare `except Exception` around the update
  fallback narrowed to `except aiosqlite.IntegrityError` — a real error in
  that path was previously reported back as success.
- `assignment_create_with_lesson` was broken by two independent bugs:
  `LEARNBOT_URL` defaulted to port `11104`, but learnbot-mcp actually runs
  on `11101`; and the request path was `/api/lessons/generate` (plural)
  against a route that's actually `/api/lesson/generate` (singular). Both
  fixed. Also fixed: the call used to treat "learnbot unreachable" and
  "lesson generation failed" the same as "no lesson attached," creating
  the assignment anyway and reporting `success: True`. Now it returns
  `success: False` with a specific error (unreachable / HTTP error /
  learnbot-reported failure) and does not create the assignment at all if
  lesson generation fails — since the tool's whole contract is "assignment
  WITH lesson," a bare assignment isn't what was asked for.

### Corrected
- The `[0.1.0]` entry below claimed this repo added
  `docs/DISTANCE_LEARNING.md`. That file lives in learnbot-mcp, not here —
  removed the claim rather than leave a changelog asserting a file exists
  that doesn't.
