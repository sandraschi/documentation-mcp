## Dependencies

| Service | Port | Required? |

| classroom-mcp API | 11105 | — |
| learnbot-mcp | 11101 | Optional (for lesson content via assignment_create_with_lesson) |

## Known gaps

- No tests — `tests/` is empty. See CHANGELOG 0.2.0 for two bugs (email
  upsert collision, learnbot-mcp bridge port/path) that shipped
  undetected because of this.
- No `README.md`, `glama.json`, or `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt`.

## What's Next

See [TODO.md](TODO.md). Priority: webapp pages (roster, courses, timetable,
progress dashboard), student-facing view, test coverage.
