Generate a working web application from a plain-text description. Runs locally on Ollama. No cloud required.

## Quick Start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/sandraschi/dark-app-factory
cd dark-app-factory
just
```

This opens an interactive dashboard showing all available commands. Run `just bootstrap` to install dependencies, then `just serve` or `just dev` to start.

### Manual Setup

If you don't have `just` installed:

## Configuration

Minimal `.env`:

```env
FOREMAN_MODEL=llama3.1:latest
WORKER_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:latest
WORKER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=65536
```

## MCP integration

Dark App Factory exposes itself as an MCP server so it can be used from Claude Desktop or as a RoboFang "AppBuilder" hand.

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "dark-app-factory": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": ["--directory", "D:/Dev/repos/dark-app-factory", "run", "daf-mcp", "--stdio"]
  }
}
```

Ports: dashboard `10738`, MCP `10739`.

## Project status

v1.8.0 — functional for React + Python/Node stacks. The Judge catches most Vite startup errors and boot failures. Complex apps with many specialists will sometimes need a second pass.
