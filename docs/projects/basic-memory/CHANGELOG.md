```python
# Simple moves with automatic folder creation
move_note("my-note", "work/projects/my-note.md")

# Organize within the active project
move_note("shared-doc", "archive/old-docs/shared-doc.md")

# Rename operations
move_note("old-name", "same-folder/new-name.md")
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Database Consistency**: Updates file paths, permalinks, and checksums automatically
- **Search Reindexing**: Maintains search functionality after moves
- **Folder Creation**: Automatically creates destination directories
- **Project Isolation**: Operates within the currently active project
- **Link Preservation**: Maintains internal links and references

#### 4. Enhanced Search & Discovery 

**Find content more easily with improved search capabilities:**

- **Frontmatter Tag Search**: Tags from YAML frontmatter are now indexed and searchable
- **Improved Content Discovery**: Search across titles, content, tags, and metadata
- **Project-Scoped Search**: Search within the currently active project
- **Better Search Quality**: Enhanced FTS5 indexing with tag content inclusion

**Example:**
```yaml
---
title: Coffee Brewing Methods
tags: [coffee, brewing, equipment]
---
```
Now searchable by: "coffee", "brewing", "equipment", or "Coffee Brewing Methods"

#### 5. Unified Database Architecture 

**Single app-level database for better performance and project management:**

- **Migration from Per-Project DBs**: Moved from multiple SQLite files to single app database
- **Project Isolation**: Proper data separation with project_id foreign keys
- **Better Performance**: Optimized queries and reduced file I/O

### Complete MCP Tool Suite

#### New Project Management Tools
- **`list_projects()`** - Discover and list all available projects with status
- **`switch_project(project_name)`** - Change active project context during conversations
- **`get_current_project()`** - Show currently active project with statistics
- **`set_default_project(project_name)`** - Update default project configuration
- **`sync_status()`** - Check file synchronization status and background operations

#### New Note Operations Tools
- **`edit_note()`** - Incremental note editing (append, prepend, find/replace, section replace)
- **`move_note()`** - Move notes with database consistency and search reindexing
- **`view_note()`** - Display notes as formatted artifacts for better readability in Claude Desktop

#### Enhanced Existing Tools
All existing tools now support:
- **Session context awareness** (operates within the currently active project)
- **Enhanced error messages** with project context metadata
- **Improved response formatting** with project information footers
- **Project isolation** ensures operations stay within the correct project boundaries


### User Experience Improvements

#### Installation Options

**Multiple ways to install and test Basic Memory:**

```bash
# Stable release
uv tool install basic-memory

# Beta/pre-releases
uv tool install basic-memory --pre
```


#### Bug Fixes & Quality Improvements

**Major issues resolved in v0.13.0:**

- **#118**: Fixed YAML tag formatting to follow standard specification
- **#110**: Fixed `--project` flag consistency across all CLI commands
- **#107**: Fixed write_note update failures with existing notes
- **#93**: Fixed custom permalink handling in frontmatter
- **#52**: Enhanced search capabilities with frontmatter tag indexing
- **FTS5 Search**: Fixed special character handling in search queries
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and validation across all tools

### Breaking Changes & Migration

#### For Existing Users

**Automatic Migration**: First run will automatically migrate existing data to the new unified database structure. No manual action required.

**What Changes:**
- Database location: Moved to `~/.basic-memory/memory.db` (unified across projects)
- Configuration: Projects defined in `~/.basic-memory/config.json` are synced with database

**What Stays the Same:**
- All existing notes and data remain unchanged
- Default project behavior maintained for single-project users
- All existing MCP tools continue to work without modification

## Summary - Add comprehensive documentation to all MCP prompt modules - Enhance search prompt with
  detailed contextual output formatting - Implement consistent logging and docstring patterns across
  prompt utilities - Fix type checking in prompt modules

## Prompts Added/Enhanced - `search.py`: New formatted output with relevance scores, excerpts, and
  next steps - `recent_activity.py`: Enhanced with better metadata handling and documentation -
  `continue_conversation.py`: Improved context management

## Resources Added/Enhanced - `ai_assistant_guide`: Resource with description to give to LLM to
  understand how to use the tools

## Technical improvements - Added detailed docstrings to all prompt modules explaining their purpose
  and usage - Enhanced the search prompt with rich contextual output that helps LLMs understand
  results - Created a consistent pattern for formatting output across prompts - Improved error
  handling in metadata extraction - Standardized import organization and naming conventions - Fixed
  various type checking issues across the codebase

This PR is part of our ongoing effort to improve the MCP's interaction quality with LLMs, making the
  system more helpful and intuitive for AI assistants to navigate knowledge bases.
