## Why Basic Memory?

Most LLM interactions are ephemeral - you ask a question, get an answer, and everything is forgotten. Each conversation
starts fresh, without the context or knowledge from previous ones. Current workarounds have limitations:

- Chat histories capture conversations but aren't structured knowledge
- RAG systems can query documents but don't let LLMs write back
- Vector databases require complex setups and often live in the cloud
- Knowledge graphs typically need specialized tools to maintain

Basic Memory addresses these problems with a simple approach: structured Markdown files that both humans and LLMs can
read
and write to. The key advantages:

- **Local-first:** All knowledge stays in files you control
- **Bi-directional:** Both you and the LLM read and write to the same files
- **Structured yet simple:** Uses familiar Markdown with semantic patterns
- **Traversable knowledge graph:** LLMs can follow links between topics
- **Standard formats:** Works with existing editors like Obsidian
- **Smart file filtering:** Automatically ignores common development directories (node_modules, __pycache__, etc.)
- **Lightweight infrastructure:** Just local files indexed in a local SQLite database

With Basic Memory, you can:

- Have conversations that build on previous knowledge
- Create structured notes during natural conversations
- Have conversations with LLMs that remember what you've discussed before
- Navigate your knowledge graph semantically
- Keep everything local and under your control
- Use familiar tools like Obsidian to view and edit notes
- Build a personal knowledge base that grows over time
- Create visual diagrams with Mermaid for better knowledge representation

## File Filtering

Basic Memory automatically ignores common development directories and files to improve performance and reduce noise. This is particularly important for:
- Node.js projects with large `node_modules` directories
- Projects with frequent build artifacts
- Development environments with log files that change often

### Ignored Patterns

#### Development Dependencies
- **Node.js**: `node_modules`
- **Python**: `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.tox`, `venv`, `.venv`

#### Build Outputs
- `dist`, `build`, `target`, `out`, `.next`, `.nuxt`
- `*.o`, `*.obj`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`

#### Package Managers
- `vendor`, `packages`, `bower_components`
- `.gradle`, `.cargo`, `coverage`

#### Logs and Temporary Files
- `*.log`, `logs/`, `*.log.*`, `*.tmp`, `*.temp`
- `npm-debug.log*`, `yarn-debug.log*`, `yarn-error.log*`

#### IDE and Editor Files
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/`, `*.sublime-*`
- `.project`, `.classpath`, `.settings/`

#### System Files
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- `desktop.ini`, `$RECYCLE.BIN/`

### Performance Impact
Filtering these files provides significant benefits:
- **Faster sync times** (especially initial sync)
- **Lower memory usage** (avoids processing large dependency trees)
- **Reduced disk I/O** (fewer files to watch and process)
- **Cleaner knowledge base** (focuses on source content, not build artifacts)

To customize these patterns, modify the `IGNORE_PATTERNS` set in the source code.

## Enhanced File Operations (Fork Feature)

**This enhanced fork significantly improves file handling performance and reliability:**

### Intelligent File Filtering
- **Automatic exclusion** of development dependencies (node_modules, __pycache__, etc.)
- **Build artifact filtering** (dist/, build/, target/, .next/, etc.)
- **Package manager directories** (vendor/, packages/, bower_components/)
- **Log file exclusion** (*.log, logs/, npm-debug.log*, etc.)
- **IDE file filtering** (.vscode/, .idea/, *.sublime-*)

### Performance Benefits
- **Faster sync times** - Especially important for initial project sync
- **Reduced memory usage** - Avoids processing large dependency trees
- **Lower disk I/O** - Fewer files to watch and process
- **Improved reliability** - Prevents timeouts on large codebases

### Developer-Friendly
- **Transparent operation** - Works automatically without configuration
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Handles all major development frameworks
- **Extensible patterns** - Easy to add custom exclusions
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

This was the original motivation for this fork - to prevent Basic Memory from becoming unresponsive when working in development environments with large dependency trees.

## Mermaid Diagram Support

Basic Memory supports Mermaid diagrams for creating visual representations of your knowledge. Add Mermaid code blocks to any note and they'll render automatically in HTML exports.

### Supported Diagram Types
- **Flowcharts** - Process flows, decision trees, workflows
- **Sequence diagrams** - API interactions, user journeys
- **Gantt charts** - Project timelines, task dependencies
- **Mind maps** - Knowledge organization, brainstorming
- **Entity relationship diagrams** - Data models, system architecture
- **State diagrams** - Process states, user flows
- **Pie charts** - Data visualization
- **And many more...**

### Example Usage

Add this to any note:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Login] --> B[Validate Credentials]
    B --> C[Credentials Valid?]
    C -->|Yes| D[Grant Access]
    C -->|No| E[Show Error]
    D --> F[Dashboard]
    E --> A
```
````

Then export to HTML to see the rendered diagram:

```bash
await export_html_notes.fn(export_path="/path/to/html-export")
```

### Export Options

#### 🐧 **Recommended: Pandoc (FREE & Open Source)**
For professional document export, use the `export_pandoc` tool which provides:
- 40+ output formats (PDF, HTML, DOCX, LaTeX, EPUB, etc.)
- Batch processing of all notes
- Custom templates and styling
- Table of contents and syntax highlighting
- Completely automated CLI processing

```bash
# Export all notes as PDF
await export_pandoc.fn(export_path="/exports", format_type="pdf")

# Export as Word document with TOC
await export_pandoc.fn(export_path="/exports", format_type="docx", toc=True)
```

#### ✏️ **FREE Markdown Editing with Notepad++**
✅ **Completely FREE & Open Source Alternative**

Basic Memory provides Notepad++ integration for professional markdown editing:
- Round-trip editing workflow (export → edit in Notepad++ → import back)
- Syntax highlighting for markdown
- Plugin ecosystem (MarkdownViewer, PreviewHTML, etc.)
- Lightweight and fast code editor
- Professional editing features

**Note:** Notepad++ is completely free and open source - no licensing costs!

See the [Mermaid Diagrams Guide](docs/mermaid-diagrams.md) for detailed documentation and examples.

## How It Works in Practice

Let's say you're exploring coffee brewing methods and want to capture your knowledge. Here's how it works:

1. Start by chatting normally:

```
I've been experimenting with different coffee brewing methods. Key things I've learned:

- Pour over gives more clarity in flavor than French press
- Water temperature is critical - around 205°F seems best
- Freshly ground beans make a huge difference
```

... continue conversation.

2. Ask the LLM to help structure this knowledge:

```
"Let's write a note about coffee brewing methods."
```

LLM creates a new Markdown file on your system (which you can see instantly in Obsidian or your editor):

```markdown
---
title: Coffee Brewing Methods
permalink: coffee-brewing-methods
tags:
- coffee
- brewing
---

# Coffee Brewing Methods

## Observations

- [method] Pour over provides more clarity and highlights subtle flavors
- [technique] Water temperature at 205°F (96°C) extracts optimal compounds
- [principle] Freshly ground beans preserve aromatics and flavor

## Relations

- relates_to [[Coffee Bean Origins]]
- requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]
- affects [[Flavor Extraction]]
```

The note embeds semantic content and links to other topics via simple Markdown formatting.

3. You see this file on your computer in real time in the current project directory (default `~/$HOME/basic-memory`).

- Realtime sync is enabled by default starting with v0.12.0
- Project switching during conversations is supported starting with v0.13.0

4. In a chat with the LLM, you can reference a topic:

```
Look at `coffee-brewing-methods` for context about pour over coffee
```

The LLM can now build rich context from the knowledge graph. For example:

```
Following relation 'relates_to [[Coffee Bean Origins]]':
- Found information about Ethiopian Yirgacheffe
- Notes on Colombian beans' nutty profile
- Altitude effects on bean characteristics

Following relation 'requires [[Proper Grinding Technique]]':
- Burr vs. blade grinder comparisons
- Grind size recommendations for different methods
- Impact of consistent particle size on extraction
```

Each related document can lead to more context, building a rich semantic understanding of your knowledge base.

This creates a two-way flow where:

- Humans write and edit Markdown files
- LLMs read and write through the MCP protocol
- Sync keeps everything consistent
- All knowledge stays in local files.

## Technical Implementation

Under the hood, Basic Memory:

1. Stores everything in Markdown files
2. Uses a SQLite database for searching and indexing
3. Extracts semantic meaning from simple Markdown patterns
    - Files become `Entity` objects
    - Each `Entity` can have `Observations`, or facts associated with it
    - `Relations` connect entities together to form the knowledge graph
4. Maintains the local knowledge graph derived from the files
5. Provides bidirectional synchronization between files and the knowledge graph
6. Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI integration
7. Exposes tools that let AI assistants traverse and manipulate the knowledge graph
8. Uses memory:// URLs to reference entities across tools and conversations

The file format is just Markdown with some simple markup:

Each Markdown file has:

### Frontmatter

```markdown
title: <Entity title>
type: <The type of Entity> (e.g. note)
permalink: <a uri slug>

- <optional metadata> (such as tags)
```

### Observations

Observations are facts about a topic.
They can be added by creating a Markdown list with a special format that can reference a `category`, `tags` using a
"#" character, and an optional `context`.

Observation Markdown format:

```markdown
- [category] content #tag (optional context)
```

Examples of observations:

```markdown
- [method] Pour over extracts more floral notes than French press
- [tip] Grind size should be medium-fine for pour over #brewing
- [preference] Ethiopian beans have bright, fruity flavors (especially from Yirgacheffe)
- [fact] Lighter roasts generally contain more caffeine than dark roasts
- [experiment] Tried 1:15 coffee-to-water ratio with good results
- [resource] James Hoffman's V60 technique on YouTube is excellent
- [question] Does water temperature affect extraction of different compounds differently?
- [note] My favorite local shop uses a 30-second bloom time
```

### Relations

Relations are links to other topics. They define how entities connect in the knowledge graph.

Markdown format:

```markdown
- relation_type [[WikiLink]] (optional context)
```

Examples of relations:

```markdown
- pairs_well_with [[Chocolate Desserts]]
- grown_in [[Ethiopia]]
- contrasts_with [[Tea Brewing Methods]]
- requires [[Burr Grinder]]
- improves_with [[Fresh Beans]]
- relates_to [[Morning Routine]]
- inspired_by [[Japanese Coffee Culture]]
- documented_in [[Coffee Journal]]
```
