# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Webapp Settings: Ollama model discovery and selection (backend endpoints + Settings page UI). System monitor portmanteau: `initialize` and `shutdown` operations for bootstrap.

### Changed
- Portmanteau-only tool surface: only 16 portmanteau tools exposed; raw core tools (CoreAvatarTools, CoreSystemTools, CoreUnityIntegrationTools) no longer registered. Bootstrap via `system_monitor(operation="initialize")`. Loops page: SOTA backend serves `/api/v1/intelligence/loops`; frontend uses relative URL and safe fallbacks.

### Fixed
- Cursor/IDE stdio MCP: FastMCP banner suppressed; stdout patched in `__main__.py` when `--stdio`/`--mcp` so no log/banner corrupts JSON-RPC stream. Webapp Loops page no longer 404/black.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **New Portmanteau Managers**: Consolidated all remaining tools into professional manager interfaces:
  - `emotion_manager`: Unified emotion, micro-expressions, and personality profiles.
  - `audio_manager`: Unified audio playback and singing synthesis.
  - `behavior_manager`: Unified AI conversation, adaptation, and learning behaviors.
  - `animation_manager`: Unified animation play/stop, sequences, and layering.
  - `collaboration_manager`: Unified multi-user sync and session management.
  - `content_manager`: Unified asset creation, listing, and publishing.
  - `interaction_manager`: Unified tactical triggers and interactive gestures.
  - `performance_manager`: Unified VRM optimization and profiling.

### Changed
