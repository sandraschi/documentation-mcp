# Changelog

All notable changes to Advanced Memory MCP will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.10.0] - Super skillmaker + capture stack (2026-07-17)

### Added
- **make_skill_advanced + adn_llm registered** (15 tools; both had `@mcp.tool`
  commented out since creation). E2E verified: research_first_create produced a
  spec-compliant, web-grounded SKILL.md on llama3.2:3b in 14.4s.
- **Session scribe** (`scripts/session_scribe.py`, hourly task): auto-captures
  Claude session transcripts into vault `inbox/` with per-session local-LLM
  summaries, repo auto-tags, dedupe via per-session seen counts; copies digests
  to aiwatcher `data/inbox/`.
- **Continue Work prompt**: latest START NOTE + recent notes + newest scribe
  digest - session context injection.
- **Version-visible /health** on both HTTP entry points (version, git_sha,
  started_at, uptime, shutting_down) per mcd HEALTH_ENDPOINT_STANDARD; the
  NSSM CLI path previously had no health route at all.
- **Webapp LLM persistence**: GET/PUT `/management/llm-config` backing the
  provider/model dropdowns; real Ollama keep_alive load/unload (were fakes).
- `services/research_sources.py`: direct DuckDuckGo/arXiv/GitHub research.
- `_version.py` (version-source drift: pyproject said 1.8.1, CHANGELOG 1.9.0).

### Fixed
- stdio proxy: restore stdout before proxy run; probe/proxy try-blocks split
  (AttributeError was mislabeled as probe failure -> hung local fallback).
- `build_error_response` tolerant signature (2-arg calls raised TypeError,
  masking every real error in make_skill_advanced).
- adn_skills markdown-string returns normalized to dict (output schema errors).
- Ollama default model: installed-model detection replaces hardcoded `llama3`.
- Deterministic SKILL.md frontmatter repair (small models omit closing `---`).
- research_driven_skill imports: modules live in `mcp/beta/`, not `mcp/tools/`.
- Read-only instances no longer run project-sync DB UPDATEs at startup.
- NSSM log litter gitignored (`data/nssm-*.log`).

### Earlier unreleased
- llms-full.txt created (was missing)
- .env.example created (was missing)
- glama.json framework updated to >=3.4.2

## [1.9.0] - Industrial Portmanteau Standard (2026-04-27)
11: 
12: ### Added
13: 
14: - **Industrial Portmanteau Standard:** Overhauled all 12 core tool modules (`audio`, `inbox`, `skills`, `zettel`, `nav`, `notes`, `search`, `knowledge`, `project`, `system`, `mcp`, `typora`) with the **2026 Improved Portmanteau** pattern.
15: - **Rationale-First Docstrings:** Every tool now includes a `[RATIONALE]` section explaining the architectural choice for consolidation, reducing LLM "floundering" in tool-dense environments.
16: - **Strict Discriminated Unions:** Migrated all Pydantic models to use `Annotated[Union[...], Field(discriminator="operation")]`. This ensures that static analyzers (Toolbench/Arcade) can resolve mutually exclusive parameter sets despite being consolidated into single entry points.
17: - **Operation Maps:** Added explicit bulleted operation maps and high-fidelity Python examples to all tool docstrings.
18: 
19: ### Documentation
20: 
21: - **MCD Standardization:** Formally codified the "Industrial Portmanteau" as the fleet-wide standard in `mcp-central-docs`.
22: - Updated **README.md** and **docs/COMPLIANCE_AND_STANDARDS.md** to reflect the new 2026 tool architecture.
23: 
24: ---
25: 
26: ## [1.8.2] - Vector store logging & Seed notes (2026-04-27)
27: 
28: ### Added
29: 
30: - **`docs/seed-notes/`** — Three **vault-ready** markdown memos (YAML frontmatter) capturing **2026-04** Google Gemini / Deep Research / Interactions / Tailscale MCP ingress news.

### Fixed

- **Observation permalinks** when the parent entity has no stored `permalink`: avoid synthesizing `none/observations/...` (from Python `None` stringification) by falling back to `file_path` or `entity-{id}` before appending `/observations/...`, matching relation behavior.
- **Vector store logging:** missing LanceDB table before first index is logged at **DEBUG** with correct loguru formatting (no misleading INFO “creating table” on every search).

### Tests

- Unpack `(rows, total)` from `SearchService.search` / `SearchRepository.search` in service, repository, sync, and API tests (callers had been treating the return value as a bare list).

## [1.8.1] - Extra RAG folders & LanceDB storage docs (2026-04-21)

### Added

- **`rag_extra_roots`** in `AdvancedMemoryConfig` (persisted in `~/.advanced-memory/config.json`): optional list of **absolute directories on the API host** whose `.md`, `.mdx`, and `.txt` files are chunked into LanceDB when you run a full **Rebuild search index**. Chunks are tagged as global extras and included in semantic / hybrid search for **every** vault project (`SearchService.index_rag_extra_roots`, widened vector metadata filter).
- **Management API:** `GET` / `PUT /api/v1/management/rag-extra-roots`, `POST /api/v1/management/rag-extra-roots/validate`.
- **Webapp Vault sync:** section **Extra RAG folders (LanceDB)** — list paths, save to config, validate on server, reload; **Folder hint** uses `showDirectoryPicker()` when available (browsers still cannot supply a drive letter; users paste the full server path).

### Documentation

- **LanceDB on disk:** the vector store directory is **`{parent of the app SQLite file}/vectors`**, typically `%USERPROFILE%\.advanced-memory\vectors` next to `memory.db` (or under `ADVANCED_MEMORY_HOME` if set). It is **not** under the git checkout by default. The config field **`rag_persist_dir` / `RAG_PERSIST_DIR`** remains legacy naming and is **not** used to choose the LanceDB path for `VectorRepository` (implementation uses the `vectors` sibling path in `deps.py` / `sync_service.py`).
- **Cross-repo clarity:** other documentation stacks (for example **mcp-central-docs**) keep their **own** LanceDB directory (that project defaults to `src/docs_mcp/data/lancedb` inside its repo). Advanced Memory does **not** share one database with unrelated repos unless an operator deliberately points two apps at the same path.
- Updated **README**, **docs/README**, **docs/PRD**, **docs/USAGE**, **docs/AI-FEATURES**, **docs/ARCHITECTURE**, **webapp/README** for the above.

### Tests

- `tests/test_search_rag_extra_helpers.py` — paragraph chunking and extra-root metadata helpers.

### Changed

- **`prefab-ui`:** dependency floor raised from **0.1.3** to **≥0.19.0** (lock resolves **0.19.1**) so installs align with the current FastMCP 3.2 Prefab / `ToolResult` stack.

### Fixed

- **FastAPI management watch:** `app.state.watch_task` is initialized in the HTTP app lifespan and management routes read it with `getattr`, so `GET /api/v1/management/watch/status` no longer raises when the watch task field was never set.
- **Webapp Note Vault (`/notes`):** Missing imports for `useBackendAutoReconnect` and the offline recovery clipboard helpers caused a runtime `ReferenceError` on every visit; the page loads again.
- **Webapp Note Vault:** Search hits and list rows may ship `tags` as an array, a JSON string, or a single string; the UI normalizes them before filtering and rendering. Opening a note from **Recent Activity** via `/notes?id=<permalink>` waits until the vault project is selected, then loads content through the knowledge entity **content** endpoint without assuming a full note DTO.
- **Webapp:** `App` metadata for the right-hand sidebar maps the slim content response safely (word counts and file size derived from body text when the API omits those fields).
- **Webapp Note Vault (tree view):** Tree building and sort no longer assume every note has a non-empty title or permalink segment.

## [1.8.0] - FastMCP 3.2 GA Managed Namespaces (2026-04-21)

### Changed - Tool surface decomposed into 12 mounted sub-apps

The monolithic `adn_*` / `portmanteau_*` tools have been decomposed into
**12 FastMCP Managed Namespaces**, each mounted as its own sub-app. Every
`operation=` branch is now a first-class tool with its own name, docstring,
and required-parameter schema. This replaces the single multi-operation
portmanteau pattern as the primary tool surface.

**Namespaces:** `audio`, `inbox`, `skills`, `zettel`, `nav`, `notes`,
`search`, `knowledge`, `project`, `system`, `mcp`, `typora`.

**Result:** 79 tools across 12 namespaces (vs. the previous ~15 portmanteau
entry points). Each tool has a verb-level name (e.g. `audio_dictate`,
`notes_write`, `search_rag`) and a schema the model can introspect
individually, which materially improves tool-selection accuracy and reduces
argument-extraction errors in clients that rank tools by description density.

#### Added
- `src/advanced_memory/mcp/tools/{audio,inbox,skills,zettel,nav,notes,search,knowledge,project,system,mcp,typora}.py` - per-namespace sub-apps built with `FastMCP(...)` and registered via `mcp.mount(app, namespace=...)` in `server.py`.
- `@audio_app.tool(task=True)` on long-running dictation, unlocking FastMCP 3.2 GA task-tool semantics (progress + cancellation).
- `zettel.customize` wired to the real `_customize_operation` (category / topic / depth / project) - was a simulation stub in the pre-refactor branch.
- `scripts/test_stdio_handshake.py` - standalone JSON-RPC handshake harness that spawns the server exactly the way Cursor / Claude Desktop do (`uv run ... --transport stdio`), performs `initialize` + `tools/list`, and prints a per-namespace tool-count breakdown. Used to verify IDE startup post-refactor (~1.2s boot, 79 tools).

#### Fixed
- `server.py` now reattaches `app_lifespan` to the mounted MCP instance (`mcp.lifespan = app_lifespan`). The refactor initially dropped this, which would have silently disabled the file watcher, project session bootstrap, and MCP resource initialization in IDE launches.
- `mcp.ToolResult(...)` -> `from fastmcp.tools import ToolResult` in `tools/search.py`, `tools/zettelmaker.py`, `tools/adn_knowledge_rag.py`, and `beta/adn_visualize.py`. The old symbol does not exist on FastMCP 3.2.
- `beta/adn_visualize.py`: dropped stale `types.ToolResult` return annotation (now `-> Any`) and removed the unused `mcp.types` import.
- `zettelmaker.py`: repaired stale `from advanced_memory.mcp.tools import write_note` -> `from advanced_memory.mcp.tools.write_note import write_note as mcp_write_note`.
- `tools/search.py`: restored `search_notes` plus its helpers (`_extract_tags_from_query_string`, `_format_search_results_as_markdown`, `_format_search_error_response`) as non-decorated logic providers. `cli/commands/tool.py` and `mcp/tools/adn_search._notes_search` both import these at module load, so the initial refactor broke the CLI entry point and prevented Cursor from ever getting a response.

#### Removed
- `src/advanced_memory/mcp/tool_registry.py`. The portmanteau + shadow-unrolling registration pipeline is obsolete; namespaces replace it.
- `ADVANCED_MEMORY_ARCADE_COMPLIANCE` shadow-unrolling (lived in `tool_registry.py`). Strict static scanners like toolbench.arcade.dev now see first-class namespaced tool names by default.
- `ADVANCED_MEMORY_FULL_TOOLS_MODE` toggle. The full tool surface is always exposed via the 12 namespaces; there is no longer a "compact" vs. "full" mode to choose between.
- `src/advanced_memory/mcp/tools/__init__.py` gutted to re-export only the shared response helpers (`build_error_response`, `build_success_response`). Tool registration now happens in `server.py` via the sub-app mounts.

#### Internal
- Legacy `adn_*` and `portmanteau_*` functions kept, but their `@mcp.tool` decorators are replaced with comments marking them as decommissioned. They remain importable as plain async functions so the new namespace wrappers can delegate to them unchanged during the transition.
- Backward compatibility: direct imports of the legacy functions from Python code continue to work; only the registered MCP tool *names* have changed (e.g. `adn_audio(operation="dictate", ...)` is now `audio_dictate(...)` on the wire).

### Migration notes for integrators

- If you called tools by MCP name from a client: switch `adn_<domain>` with an `operation` argument to `<domain>_<operation>` with the operation's actual parameters. Run `scripts/test_stdio_handshake.py` against your checkout for the authoritative per-namespace tool list.
- If you relied on `ADVANCED_MEMORY_FULL_TOOLS_MODE=true` to get the "atomic" surface, remove it: that surface is now the default.
- If you set `ADVANCED_MEMORY_ARCADE_COMPLIANCE=true` for toolbench / Arcade scans, remove it: namespaced tool names are already first-class and scanner-visible.

## [1.7.1] - Sync Performance Fix (2026-04-16)

### Fixed - Critical Sync Performance Regression

#### `sync_service.py` — `handle_move`: skip re-index on path-only moves

**Problem:** `handle_move` unconditionally called `search_service.index_entity()` after
every move, even when only the path separator changed (`/` → `\` on Windows). This
re-read the full file from disk and rebuilt the entire trigram FTS stem index for every
entity — turning a 2,822-file path-normalisation pass into a multi-hour operation (~8h
on a 3,000-entity vault).

**Fix:** Introduced `content_changed` flag. `index_entity` is now only called when
`update_permalinks_on_move=True` causes a real file rewrite. Pure path-separator moves
use the new `search_service.update_entity_path()` — a cheap SQL UPDATE on `file_path`
with no file I/O.

**Result:** 2,822 path-only moves: ~7 hours → ~3 minutes.

#### `sync_service.py` — `resolve_relations`: remove gratuitous re-index

**Problem:** After resolving each wikilink relation (`to_id`/`to_name` update only),
`index_entity` was called on the resolved entity. Relation resolution does not change
file content; the search index was already correct. On a large vault this added ~21
minutes of unnecessary re-indexing after every sync.

**Fix:** Removed the `index_entity` call from `resolve_relations`. The search index
for entity content is unchanged by relation resolution.

**Result:** `resolve_relations` phase: ~21 minutes → ~2 minutes.

#### `search_repository.py` — new `update_entity_path` method

Added lightweight `update_entity_path(entity_id, new_file_path)` that issues a single
`UPDATE search_index SET file_path = :new_path WHERE entity_id = :id` without reading
or re-stemming file content. Used by `handle_move` for path-only renames.

**Combined improvement: full sync of a 3,000-entity vault with 2,951 path moves went
from ~8 hours to ~5 minutes.**

## [1.6.1] - Tool Modernization & Zero Noise Docs (2026-03-30)

### ðŸš€ **FastMCP 3.1 Modernization**

#### Refactored - Zero Noise Tool Documentation
- **Annotated Signatures**: Migrated core tools (`search_notes`, `write_note`, `read_note`, `recent_activity`, `status`, `build_context`) to use `Annotated[Type, Field(description="...")]` for parameter documentation.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Documentation now resides exclusively in the function signature, ensuring the MCP JSON schema is automatically generated without redundant docstring "Args" blocks.
- **LLM Optimization**: Removed verbose and repetitive "Args" and "Returns" sections from docstrings to reduce token noise and improve agentic tool selection.

### ðŸ”§ **Code Quality & Maintenance**

#### Fixed - Repository-Wide Linting (Ruff)
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Executed `ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes` and `ruff format` across the entire repository.
- **SOTA Standards**: Resolved 90+ linting issues, including:
  - Migration to native `datetime.UTC` (removing deprecated `utcnow`).
  - Adoption of modern `isinstance(x, A | B)` syntax and `X | Y` type unions.
  - Fixes for B905 (zip strictness) and UP035/UP006 (modern typing imports).
- **Import Optimization**: Removed unused imports and resolved import sorting (I001) in critical modules.
- **Zero Noise Modernization**: Eliminated redundant docstring "Args" and "Returns" across the entire codebase.

### ðŸ¢ **Industrial Rebranding**

#### Refactored - Professional Technical Persona
- **Branding Purge**: Removed all scifi-lore and dramatic AI terminology (e.g., "OpenFang", "Substrate", "Audio Soul", "Cognitive Bridge") from documentation and source code.
- **Documentation Sanitization**: Overhauled `README.md` and `TECHNICAL.md` with industrial-grade technical descriptions focusing on Knowledge Management and Research.
- **UI Labeling Optimization**: Updated Webapp labels in `Dashboard.tsx` and `GraphCanvas.tsx` to reflect the new professional identity (e.g., "Knowledge Management Layer", "Skill Library", "Knowledge Graph").

---

## [1.6.0] - Modernization & Prefab UI 0.2 (2026-03-30)

### ðŸš€ **UI/UX Modernization**

#### Migrated to Prefab UI 0.2 (FastMCP 3.1)
- **App Engine**: Replaced deprecated `App` with `PrefabApp` and migrated all prefabs to the new reactive component structure.
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Implemented `pf-glass` and `pf-outline` SOTA 2026 design patterns across the toolset.
- **Knowledge Visualization**: Replaced legacy `Graph` component with a dynamic **Mermaid** flowchart for interactive relationship mapping.
- **Improved Layouts**: Refactored grid systems to use the new `GridColumn` and standard `Column`/`Row` components for high-fidelity responses.

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Stability**

#### Fixed - Tool Runtime Stability
- **Missing Imports**: Resolved critical `NameError` in `read_note.py` and other tool files where `Any` was used without an import.
- **Dependency Cleanliness**: Automated cleanup of unused imports in `prefabs.py` to ensure O-lint codebase.
- **Protocol Compliance**: Verified FastMCP 3.1 `ToolResult` serialization for rich UI payloads.

## [1.5.0] - Semantic Research (RAG) & Performance Surge (2026-02-27)

### ðŸš€ **Semantic Intelligence (RAG)**

#### Added - LanceDB Vector Search Integration
- **LanceDB Implementation**: Integration of LanceDB for high-performance vector storage and hybrid search.
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Adoption of `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` via `fastembed` for generating state-of-the-art semantic embeddings.
- **Hybrid Search Architecture**: Combined FTS5 keyword search with LanceDB semantic retrieval for maximum relevance.
- **Semantic Chunking**: Implemented paragraph-based chunking logic to optimize document granularity for RAG.

### âš¡ **Performance & Stability**

#### Fixed - N+1 Query Resolution
- **Batch Fetching**: Refactored API routers (specifically `utils.py`) to use batch fetching (`EntityRepository.find_all`) instead of individual queries, drastically reducing backend latency for large note lists.
- **Pagination Hook**: Prepared backend infrastructure for paginated entity retrieval.

#### Fixed - Build & UI Stability
- **CSS Build Fix**: Resolved a malformed Tailwind CSS shadow rule in `main.css` that was causing Vite build failures.

---

## [1.4.1] - Sampling Bug Fix (2026-02-22)

### Fixed

#### FastMCP 2.14.1+ Sampling API â€” `inter_server_tools.py` rewrite
- **Root cause**: `mcp/sampling.py` accessed `mcp.ctx` which does not exist on FastMCP instances. `mcp/inter_server.py` used a manual tool-call loop with dict-formatted tools â€” the pre-2.14.1 low-level pattern incompatible with `ctx.sample(tools=[...])`.
- **Symptom**: All three agentic meta-tools (`agentic_content_workflow`, `intelligent_batch_processor`, `sampling_capabilities_status`) raised `AttributeError` at call time.
- **Fix â€” `mcp/tools/inter_server_tools.py`**: Full rewrite using the correct FastMCP 2.14.1+ SEP-1577 pattern:
  - 5 real async leaf-tool functions (no mocks, no lambdas), each calling the actual service layer
  - `ctx: Context` parameter â€” correct name for FastMCP auto-injection (old code used `context`)
  - `ctx.sample(messages=..., tools=[fn,...], result_type=PydanticModel)` for LLM orchestration
  - `WorkflowResult` and `BatchResult` Pydantic models for validated structured output
  - Tool group registry mapping `available_tools` strings to Python callables
- **Fix â€” `mcp/inter_server.py`**: Gutted. Entire `AgenticWorkflow` / `sample_with_tools` / `create_tool_spec` machinery removed. Kept as import stub.
- **Fix â€” `mcp/sampling.py`**: Gutted. Broken `SamplingClient` wrapper removed. Kept as import stub.

## [1.4.0] - Ecosystem Integration & Advanced Collaboration (2026-02-17)

### ðŸš€ **Ecosystem Observability**

#### Added - Apps Hub (Fleet Discovery)
- **Fleet Scanning**: Implementation of `AppsHub.tsx` for real-time monitoring of active MCP instances across the reserved port range (10700â€“10800+).
- **Service Detection**: Automated discovery of Robotics MCP, GroxTools, and Security services with status indicators and port analysis.
- **Search & Filtering**: Fleet-wide search for active services by name, type, or port.

#### Added - Agent Control Room
- **Live Observability**: Implementation of `ControlRoom.tsx` for real-time monitoring of agent execution steps via a simulated terminal feed.
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed session history tracking tool calls, token utilization, and substrate telemetry.
- **Session Management**: Capability to monitor and audit active agentic sessions with high-fidelity telemetry.

#### Added - Intelligence Panel & Hardware API
- **Sidebar Integration**: Persistent `IntelligencePanel.tsx` widget integrated into the global sidebar.
- **Substrate Telemetry**: Real-time tracking of GPU (RTX 4094), CPU (24-core), and System Memory utilization.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Native `api.ts` methods for substrate detection (`detectHardware`) and model parameter optimization (`optimizeModelParams`).

### ðŸ”§ **UI/UX Enhancements**

- **Navigation Integration**: Added "Apps Hub" and "Control Room" to the main application routing and sidebar navigation.
- **Visual Polish**: Glassmorphism and micro-animations applied to all Phase 4 components for SOTA-compliant aesthetic.
- **Linting & Type Safety**: Resolved all linting warnings and type mismatches in the newly implemented frontend stack.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - Hardened MCP Startup & Lock Recovery (2026-04-09)

- **PID-Aware Locking**: Enhanced the `_stdio_single_instance_lock` context manager to store the active process ID (PID) in the lock file. If a conflict occurs, the error message now explicitly identifies the PID of the process holding the lock.
- **Automated Startup Cleanup**: Hardened `start.ps1` with a "Clean Slate" routine that proactively removes stale `mcp-stdio.lock` files and terminates orphaned `advanced-memory` or `am mcp` processes before server launch.
- **Graceful Cleanup**: Ensured the lock file is explicitly removed upon graceful server shutdown.

### Fixed - Cursor / MemOps MCP startup (2026-03-07)

- **MCP config must use `mcp` subcommand and `--transport stdio`**: Without them the process runs the CLI and exits; the server only starts with `advanced-memory mcp --transport stdio`. README and docs updated.
- **docs/CURSOR_MCP_SETUP.md**: New doc with correct Cursor/Claude MCP config (command, args including `mcp` and `--transport stdio`), where to put it, and why the previous config failed. README "Supported MCP Clients" links to it.
- **Cursor config**: Use full path to `uv` (e.g. `D:/Dev/repos/uv-install/uv.exe`) if `uv` is not on PATH when Cursor starts the subprocess.

### Added - Semantic search API and Deep Search UI (2026-03-05)

- **POST `/{project}/search/semantic`**: Request body `{ query, limit }`. Returns RAG chunks (entity_id, permalink, title, snippet, chunk_text, score) from LanceDB vector search + rerank. Used by the Deep Search page.
- **GET `/{project}/knowledge/entities/{identifier:path}/content`**: Returns full note content as JSON `{ title, permalink, content }` for a given permalink/path. Enables "click chunk to show full note" in the UI. Route declared before the generic entity route so `/content` is matched correctly.
- **SearchDeep.tsx**: Replaced mock data with real API calls. Fetches current project from `getProjects()`, calls semantic search API, displays real chunks; on chunk click calls note-content API and shows full note in a modal.
- **api.ts**: `searchSemanticChunks(project, query, limit)` and `getNoteContent(project, permalink)`.
- **Schemas**: `SemanticSearchRequest`, `SemanticChunkResult`, `SemanticSearchResponse` in `schemas/search.py`; `NoteContentResponse` in `schemas/response.py`.
- **Tests**: `test_semantic_search_returns_schema` (POST semantic, response shape); `test_get_entity_content` (GET entity content JSON). Conftest: `search_service` fixture updated for `SearchService` constructor (`vector_repository`, `app_config`); added `vector_repository` fixture for tests.

### Fixed - Webapp startup and docs (2026-03-05)

- **start.ps1**: Run npm install and Vite from `webapp/frontend/` (where `package.json` lives) instead of `webapp/` to avoid ENOENT. Start Python backend from repository root so `advanced_memory` is importable.
- **Backend health check**: After starting the backend, wait up to ~12s and verify port 10705 is listening; print "Backend is up" or a warning before starting Vite.
- **main.css**: Fix Tailwind `@apply` for `.indigo-glow` â€” use `rgba(99_102_241_0.3)` (underscores) so commas in arbitrary values are not parsed as class separators (PostCSS error resolved).
- **Docs**: Dedicated [webapp/README.md](webapp/README.md) for webapp architecture, ports, start.ps1/start.bat, and troubleshooting. Main README links to it under Web Interface and Standalone Web Application.

### Added - Skills Factory (Research Chaining + LLM-Guided Loop) (2026-02-10)

#### skill_research_chain.py (2026-02-10)
- **ResearchChainService**: Chains arxiv, github, rag, web research with LLM-guided gap analysis
- **ResearchBundle** dataclass: topic, snippets, citations, synthesis, gaps_remaining, coverage_score, iteration_count, sources_used
- **ResearchGapAnalysis** Pydantic model: synthesis, gaps, next_sources, coverage_score, should_continue
- **run_chain()**: Runs research sources in batches; after each batch, LLM analyzes findings and decides next sources; loops until coverage >= threshold or max_iterations

#### adn_skills_research MCP tool (2026-02-10)
- New tool: topic, sources, max_iterations, coverage_threshold, output_format (bundle|skill_draft)
- Exposed via adn_skills(operation="research") in portmanteau mode
- Exposed as adn_skills_research in FULL tools mode

#### Documentation (2026-02-10)
- mcp-central-docs: SKILLS_FACTORY_RESEARCH_DARK_APP_PATTERN.md, ADN_CONTENT_NOTE_SKILLS_FACTORY.md, SKILLS_FACTORY_TODO.md, ADN_CONTENT_STATUS_SKILLS_FACTORY.md
- advanced-memory-mcp: docs/SKILLS_FACTORY_TODO.md
- Pattern inspired by Dark App Factory specialist council

#### reference_scaffolder.py (2026-02-10)
- **scaffold_references_from_research()**: Creates references/REFERENCE.md (synthesis, gaps, citations) and references/SOURCES.md (bib-style)

## [Unreleased] - Skill Directory Configuration (2026-01-21)

### ðŸš€ **Content Enhancement**

#### Added - find_runts and find_junk (2026-01-31)
- **find_runts**: Find short/runt notes (content under max_content_length) for batch enhancement. Available via adn_content and adn_knowledge_bulk.
- **find_junk**: LLM quality assessment of notes. Returns narrative (default) or structured JSON with criteria: clarity, completeness, structure, factual_accuracy, outdated_tech, needs_expansion. Available via adn_content and adn_knowledge_bulk.

#### Added - adn_content enhance Tool (2026-01-31)
- **replace_body operation**: Fixed bug where enhanced content was not persisted. Added `replace_body` edit operation that replaces entire note body while preserving frontmatter.
- **Enhance parameters**: Granular control over enhancement behavior:
  - `update_content` (default True): Fix typos, factual errors, biographical updates (e.g. death dates)
  - `update_style` (default True): Improve clarity, structure, readability
  - `add_bibliography` (default False): Add References/Bibliography section
  - `add_examples` (default False): Add concrete examples, illustrations, case studies
  - `add_context` (default False): Add background, definitions, "why it matters"
  - `expand_sections` (default False): Turn bullet points into full paragraphs; runt notes into full notes
  - `update_stale_tech` (default False): Update outdated lib/tool versions (e.g. FastMCP 2.10 -> 2.14); flags uncertainty
  - `content` (optional): Custom instruction passed to LLM (scope, facts, version lock, tone)
- **Biographical updates**: When `update_content=True`, adds death dates and life events for persons who died after the note was written.
- **Structured responses**: Enhance now returns dict (not string) for MCP client compatibility.
- **edit_note replace_section**: Clearer error message when section is missing; suggests `replace_body` for full replacement.
- **Documentation**: PORTMANTEAU_TOOLS_REFERENCE.md and TOOLS_REFERENCE.md updated with full enhance docs.

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Fixes**

#### Fixed - Windsurf/Antigravity Skills Not Loading (2026-01-28)
- **Recursive skill scan**: Bridge now discovers `SKILL.md` in nested directories (e.g. `skills/category/skill-name/SKILL.md`, WindSurf/Antigravity flat layout).
- **Path resolution**: Skill roots use `path.resolve`; `USERPROFILE`/`HOME` required for user-based dirs; `getSkillDirectory` returns `null` when missing.
- **Cross-drive `filePath`**: On Windows, `path.relative` can fail for paths on different drives. Added `safeFilePath` fallback using `folderName/dirName/SKILL.md` when relative path is cross-drive or absolute.
- **Frontmatter fallback**: If `SKILL.md` has no valid frontmatter, a skill is still emitted with `title` from directory name and full file as `content` (no longer skipped).
- **Robust frontmatter parsing**: Relaxed regex (`^\s*---`), trim leading content; only parse top-level key/value lines (skip indented YAML such as `allowed-tools:`, `metadata:` blocks) to avoid malformed metadata.

#### Fixed - Skill Directory Locations
- **Corrected IDE Skill Paths**: Fixed skill scanning to use user home directories instead of project directory
- **Cursor Skills**: `C:\Users\[username]\.cursor\skills-cursor`
- **Windsurf Skills**: `C:\Users\[username]\.codeium\windsurf\skills`
- **Antigravity Skills**: `C:\Users\[username]\.gemini\antigravity\skills`
- **ADN Skills**: `D:\Dev\repos\advanced-memory-mcp\skills` (unchanged)

#### Added - Documentation Updates
- **Skill Locations**: Added prominent skill directory documentation to README.md

- Improved test infrastructure with proper fixtures
- Enhanced project configuration management
- **Mypy strict mode improvements** - Major progress toward full type safety
  - Fixed all 30+ var-annotated errors (variables needing explicit types)
  - Fixed all 20+ FunctionTool operator errors in portmanteau tools
  - Added return type annotations to 30+ utility functions
       - **Milestone 1**: Reduced errors from 587 to 480 (107 fixed, 18% reduction)
       - **Milestone 2**: Reduced errors from 587 to 444 (143 fixed, 24% reduction)
       - Broke the 500-error barrier!
       - Broke the 450-error barrier!
  - Remaining work: ~480 errors (arg-type, return-value, attr-defined)
- **Improved sync reliability** - No longer hangs on large/weird files or malformed frontmatter
  - Every file operation wrapped in error handling
  - Sync continues even if individual files fail
  - Clear logging of skipped files and reasons
- **Enhanced sync status display** - Clear, actionable progress information
  - Shows which project is currently syncing
  - Displays progress percentage (X/Y files, Z% complete)
  - Clear status indicators: [SYNCING], [WATCHING], [READY], [OK], [ERROR]
  - Helpful messages explain what's happening and what to do
  - No more vague "pending" messages

### Fixed
- Test import errors in integration tests
- Configuration class naming (`BasicMemoryConfig` â†’ `AdvancedMemoryConfig`)
- Missing dependencies in MCP server
- CI workflow trigger conditions
- MCPB package structure and manifest
- **Critical docsify export bug** - 'md_path' KeyError causing complete export failure
  - Root cause: Sidebar creation before note export (order dependency)
  - Fixed: Reordered operations to export notes before creating sidebar
  - Added md_path key to exported_files data structure
  - All docsify exports now working correctly
- **Sync hanging issues** - Large files, encoding errors, malformed markdown, malformed frontmatter no longer cause hangs
  - Sync loop never crashes on individual file errors
  - Complete error recovery and continuation logic
- 131 test failures resolved (from 155 failures to 24)
